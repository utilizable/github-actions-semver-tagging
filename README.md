To reuse this actions you need to create github actions workflow file inside your targeted repository.

`./.github/workflows/semver.yml`
```yml
name: semver

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  semver:
    uses: utilizable/github-actions-semver-tagging/.github/workflows/semver.yml@develop
```

## ðŸ”– Versioning model

Versions have the format `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>(.<PATCH>)?` where:

- `<MAJOR>` Triggered manualy from default branch,
- `<MINOR>` Triggered automaticly after each push from default branch,
- `<PATCH>` Triggered automaticly after each push from fix/A.B.C branch.
